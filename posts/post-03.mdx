## Introduction

Welcome to the MDX testing content. Below are several sections with nested headings to illustrate the hierarchical structure.

### What is MDX?

MDX stands for Markdown for the component era. It's a way to write JSX embedded in markdown.

```javascript
console.log("This is a code block and shouldn't affect the hierarchy.");
```

### Why use MDX?

1. You can **import** components.
2. It's really cool!

#### Pros of MDX

- Embed JSX
- Use markdown syntax
- Extend with custom components

#### Cons of MDX

Not many, but it's good to know both Markdown and JSX.

## MDX vs Markdown

This section compares MDX and traditional markdown.

### Similarities

They both originate from the idea of easy-to-read text formats.

### Differences

MDX supports JSX out of the box. Traditional markdown does not.

```jsx
// templates/community.jsx
export default function ({ pageContext }) {
  return (
    <p>{pageContext.githubData.stargazers_count}</p>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful way to combine Markdown and JSX. Happy writing!
